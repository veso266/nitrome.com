## This is a hacked version I found here: http://www.play337.com/a.asp?id=7
SWF URL: http://games.211games.com/o/flipside-super/xuanzhuan.swf

All the levels are unlocked and the game does reqeust levels from here: http://games.211games.com/o/flipside-super/levels/

the levels url is the same

It does POST its score here: http://games.211games.com/o/flipside-super/

this version aperently uses string encryption for its obfuscation
