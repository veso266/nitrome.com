# nitrome.com
This repository contains games from nitrome.com

In the old days I liked playing them A LOT!

But now I like cracking them


All the games hosted here were unlocked to be able to be played on any domain (if domain is not cdn.nitrome.com or www.nitrome.com the game will refuse to launch and display a scarry messsage)

Tools for theese games are written in what language comes to my mind when cracking them (but will usually be Python (2.7))


## MINICLIP, STOP STEALING GAMES FROM NITROME
